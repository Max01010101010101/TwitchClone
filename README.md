# TwitchClone
This is a example of a Android app that uses the twitch api's to create the same flow as the offical App.

#Libraries Used
Retrofit - used for doing http requests
Gson - google json parser
EventBus - used to send events through out the app
Picasso - used to load images in the app 

#Whats here?
The main navigation from the Twitch production app is there. You can view channels but you cannot click on them 
to launch the intent to show the stream and chat.
